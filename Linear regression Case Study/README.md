# Boom Bikes Analysis-Linear Regression
> Outline a brief description of your project.

A bike-sharing system is a service where bikes are made available for short-term use, either for a fee or free of charge. Many bike-sharing systems allow users to borrow a bike from a computer-controlled "dock" by entering payment information, after which the system unlocks the bike. The bike can then be returned to any other dock within the same system.

Recently, BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, has experienced significant revenue declines due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The company is struggling to sustain itself in the current market conditions. To address this challenge, BoomBikes aims to develop a strategic business plan to boost revenue once the lockdown ends and the economy recovers.

In preparation for the post-quarantine period, BoomBikes seeks to understand the demand for shared bikes among the public. Their goal is to be ready to meet the needs of customers once the situation improves, differentiate themselves from competitors, and achieve substantial profits.

BoomBikes has hired a consulting firm to analyze the factors influencing the demand for shared bikes in the American market. Specifically, they want to identify the significant variables that predict bike demand and understand how well these variables explain the demand.

Based on various meteorological surveys and lifestyle data, the service provider has collected a comprehensive dataset on daily bike demand across the American market.

Business Goal: You are tasked with modeling the demand for shared bikes using the available independent variables. This model will help management understand how demand varies with different features, allowing them to adjust their business strategy to meet demand levels and customer expectations. Additionally, the model will provide insights into the demand dynamics of a new market.
